pcapfix v0.2 README
*******************

Pcapfix is a tool to repair your damaged or corrupted pcap files. It is
written in C and released under the GNU General Public License.

To fix your files the tool first checks for an intact pcap global header
and repairs it if there are some corrupted bytes. It there seems to be
no global header at all, pcapfix adds a self-created one at the beginning
of the file. In a second step the tool tries to find pcap packet headers
inside the file, below the global header. It checks if the values are
correct (or seem to be correct) and tries to repair a packet if there is
something wrong. Therefore it grabs the packets from below (the end of
the file) and will generate a new correct packet header at the packet that
is corrupted.

This tool is still in development! Please send any further wishes, feature
requests or problems in compiling and execution to ruport@f00l.de.
